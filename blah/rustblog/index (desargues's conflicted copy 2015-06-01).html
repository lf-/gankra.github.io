<p>A while ago I had an annoying problem: I would like to write blog posts about Rust, but all I have at my disposal is a static file server that I can&#39;t modify on a system I have no priviledges on. I could post things on Github or like Mediumblr or something, but that didn&#39;t feel... right. I want to host my own words, damn it!</p>

<p>Now, I can definitely hand-write everything in html. At some limit, that&#39;s eveything I host. Still, I <em>really</em> like markdown. I&#39;d also be writing a lot about code, which html is kinda janky at. I want to be lazy, damn it!</p>

<p>So like pandoc or something is probably a thing... I&#39;d have to look that up... download stuff... install it... figure out how it works... nonono, all wrong! See the previous proclamation for details.</p>

<p>What I <em>did</em> know is that the Rust compiler has a nifty little too called rustdoc, for building documentation. It&#39;s most powerful feature is scraping an entire crate&#39;s source and building nice static html indexes. However more obscure is that you can just feed it markdown files, and it will spit out html. That&#39;s how TRPL is built. It comes with the rest of the compiler tools, so it&#39;s even already in my <code>$PATH</code>. Sounds like what I want!</p>

<p>The only special thing it requires from your file is a title line prefixed by a <code>%</code>. It works pretty ok on its own but the raw output is pretty... raw. No source highlighting. No CSS. On the other end of the spectrum, it produces this TOC that I really don&#39;t like. And spits the file out in a <code>doc/</code> folder (which it would just crash on the absence of!).</p>

<p>Thankfully, <code>rustdoc --help</code> is full of little goodies:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">&gt; rustdoc --help
/Users/ABeingessner/.multirust/toolchains/nightly/bin/rustdoc [options] &lt;input&gt;

Options:
    -h --help           show this help message

                        file
    --html-in-header FILES
                        files to include inline in the &lt;head&gt; section of a
                        rendered Markdown file or generated documentation
    --html-before-content FILES
                        files to include inline between &lt;body&gt; and the content
                        of a rendered Markdown file or generated documentation
    --html-after-content FILES
                        files to include inline between the content and
                        &lt;/body&gt; of a rendered Markdown file or generated
                        documentation
    --markdown-playground-url URL
                        URL to send code snippets to
    --markdown-no-toc   don&#39;t include table of contents

</code></pre>

<p>Right at the bottom is a direct answer to one of my problems: <code>--markdown-no-toc</code>. For a bit I got by with the rest by just hand-editing the HTML. Paste in the CSS, add some extra html hooks for the CSS, etc. Unfortunately this was pretty brittle to editing the text!</p>

<p>Someone on the internet helpfully pointed out that my code <em>was</em> being marked up for code highlighting, I just didn&#39;t have the CSS for it. Having worked on rustdoc a bit myself, I knew roughly where that would have to be. A quick ctrl+f for <code>code</code> brought up <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/doc/rust.css#L224-L233">this</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">/* Code highlighting */
pre.rust .kw { color: #8959A8; }
pre.rust .kw-2, pre.rust .prelude-ty { color: #4271AE; }
pre.rust .number, pre.rust .string { color: #718C00; }
pre.rust .self, pre.rust .boolval, pre.rust .prelude-val,
pre.rust .attribute, pre.rust .attribute .ident { color: #C82829; }
pre.rust .comment { color: #8E908C; }
pre.rust .doccomment { color: #4D4D4C; }
pre.rust .macro, pre.rust .macro-nonterminal { color: #3E999F; }
pre.rust .lifetime { color: #B76514; }
</code></pre>

<p>which I promptly stole.</p>

<p>I still was hand-editing some stuff into the file, though. After a couple posts I decided the time waste had reach a critical mass and paid a little more attention to the above flags. The three <code>--html-*</code> flags give me exactly the places I was editing content into. Then I just tossed it all in a bash script so that I could forget how to do all of this <em>forever</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">#!/bin/bash

mkdir doc
rustdoc --markdown-no-toc --html-in-header ../rustblog/head.html --html-before-content ../rustblog/before.html --html-after-content ../rustblog/after.html &quot;$1.md&quot;
mv -f &quot;doc/$1.html&quot; ./
rm -rf doc
</code></pre>

<p>And thus <code>rustblog</code> was born. Was it worth it? I don&#39;t even know. But heck, it works. <a href="index.md">Here&#39;s this post&#39;s text</a>.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        window.playgroundUrl = "";
    </script>
    </div>

</body>
